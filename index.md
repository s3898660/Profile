				<h2>Introduction</h2>
			</header>
			<p>Travis Lim, S3898660, s3898660@student.rmit.edu.au.
Hi there! Thats me. I am an Australian born overseas and raised in an Indonesian household. I speak english and have completed primary and secondary education at Good News Lutheran College. I graduated from secondary education last year in 2020 and have received an ATAR. 
</p>
            <p>A fun fact about me is that I like to talk… a lot. Sometimes discussions run on for far too long when I am talking, much like this page will; There won’t be another page, just this one long wall of text.</p>

					<p>As an INTP-T, I am more likely to look at the finer details and break down problems to find solutions. However, I am more likely to question my decisions and change my mind quicker. I am also a hands-on learner with a high level of a regular level of conscientiousness, which means I can understand other people to a normal degree. However, my introversion and extroversion are contradicting in two of the results.</p>
					<p>I believe I would fit well in a team as a planner and analyst. I would probably not be a good fit for leadership roles because of my turbulent personality but I would fit well in a team that can let me do my work and contribute without the need to make decisions on behalf of the group. I may be more silent and less interactive with my group if left to do work.</p>
					<p>When looking for a group I would want an extroverted person to take the lead and organise workloads for the group members. I would also be looking for someone with a high level conscientiousness, that understands clearly what people desire in IT products. I would also look for someone with a great sense of aesthetics to cover for the look of projects.</p>

				<h2>My Background</h2>
			</header>
			
				<section>
					<h3>From Humble Beginnings</h3>
					<p>My interest in IT mainly focuses on software development and cyber security. This can largely be attributed to my time in year 8 programming class where my teacher, Mr Gannell, signed a group of 4 students (including me) into the Victorian Games and Apps Challenge (we won the year 8 division). I would say my interest in software development stems from there. Nevertheless, during later years, Mr Gannell got me interested in cyber security because of its importance and demand.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Why RMIT?</h3>
					<p>I chose to study at RMIT because I heard that it was a good place to learn about IT. Furthermore, my mom studied here over two decades ago and recommended it to me. RMIT also has a campus in the city so I naturally thought “Wow, convenient!” which it has been for the better part of a month. Among other things, a bunch of my high school friends are also studying here.</p>
				</section>
				
				
				<section>
					<h3>Expectations</h3>
					<p>I expect to learn how to code in a few relevant languages during my time studying here. I also hope to learn how to work in cybersecurity during my time in RMIT. I would also expect to learn how to work in group project oriented settings like how it would work in the real world.</p>

				<h2>Project Idea</h2>
			</header>
			     <section>
				 <h3>Project Overview</h3>
				 <p>My project idea is a motion sensing toilet paper dispenser. The project will enable users to access toilet paper without having to manually pluck pieces off from a roll and potentially make uneven and annoying to handle strands of toilet paper. Utilising a motion sensor to trigger a small rotor to spin and lower toilet paper, the device is meant to reduce direct exposure to surfaces normally touched commonly in public restrooms. The device also uses a scissor-like tool to seperate the toilet paper the user wants to use from the roll.</p>
				 </section>
				 
				 <section>
				 <h3>My Motivation</h3>
				 <p>My motivation for making this device is from anecdotal experiences in the public restrooms. One does not know who has come in contact with manual toilet paper dispensers and they cannot ask either. The idea of putting trust that everyone is not flailing their hands about all over the dispenser is optimistic at best. So my device is a solution that brings peace of mind and significantly reduces direct exposure to surfaces in prestrooms. Users will no longer have to manually pull toilet paper and rip them from the rolls, ensuring a more easy to use toilet experience.</p>
				 </section>
				 
				 <section>
				 <h3>The Project Description</h3>
				 <p>The motion sensing toilet paper dispenser uses 4 distinct parts for the entire device to function.</p>
				 <p>The first part is the motion sensor. The motion sensor is meant to detect the user’s hand as it draws closer to the sensor without directly touching it. The sensor prevents the contact of a human and a surface that other humans touch. This prevents the spread of germs from person to person. The sensor should also be able to record the amount of time that a person has their hand in close proximity to the scanner, which will trigger a rotor to spin longer and dispense more toilet paper for the user to use.</p>
				 <p>The second part of the device is a rotor. This rotor spins a small cylinder which is where toilet paper rolls are usually stored and dispensed from. This rotor spins whenever the motion sensor detects motion in close proximity. Attached to the cylinder is a small clamp which fastens the cardboard part of a toilet paper roll to the cylinder and makes sure it spins according to how much the rotor spins rather than dangling freely. The rotor should spin for a time proportional to how long the motion sensor detects something, dispensing as much toilet paper as the user requires.</p>
				 <p>The third part of the motion sensing toilet paper dispenser is a blade which severs the user’s needed toilet paper from the main roll. This device is hidden well inside the frame of the device to avoid accidentally severing the user’s fingers. The blade is also protected by a layer of plastic which is meant to stop a user from creeping their fingers inside of the device’s frame and severing their fingers. The blade activates after the rotor has finished dispensing the required amount of toilet paper, cutting the toilet paper and leaving it in the user’s hand for contactless delivery.</p>
				 <p>The fourth part of the product is the protective frame. The frame contains the rotor, toilet paper, the blade, all in the inside of the frame. On the outside is the motion sensor at the front of the frame facing the user. The frame has a long snout-like piece which is what contains the blade and also allows for toilet paper to flow through. The also has a hinge at the top which has a hatch connected to it so someone can open it up when there is no toilet paper left and refill it.</p>
				 </section>
				 
				 <section>
				 <h3>Hardware and Software </h3>
				 <p>The device requires access to a rotor and motion sensor as well as a specially designed blade for sole usage in cutting toilet paper. To make the frame I require a CAD software such as FreeCAD to create a 3D printable model which I can then print on a 3D printer. I also need to use a programming software to program the blade and rotor to operate when triggered by the motion sensor. Other parts needed are a clamp which can be fastened to a cylinder to secure a roll of toilet paper to the device.</p>
				 </section>
				 
				 <section>
				 <h3>Skills Required</h3>
				 <p>I need to be able to write code to get a rotor and blade to function in the case of the event where the motion sensor is triggered. This can be done on Arduino. I also need to be able to operate CAD software to be able to model the frame of the device. Another required skill is to be able to put all of the parts together and make it so that nothing conflicts in the design for a streamlined and efficient performance. Skills in planning are essential along with knowledge in how electricity works so that the device does not have any power supply issues.</p>
				 </section>
				 
				 <section>
				 <h3>The Outcome</h3>
				 <p>The ultimate outcome of the program is the reduction of the need of manually retrieving toilet paper in a restroom. If the project is successful, I intend for this to be used in the battle against COVID-19, reducing contact on surfaces already touched by other people, hence reducing the spread of the virus and other germs. This will also instil a strong peace of mind in users as they no longer have to fear that they are coming in contact with possibly infectious surfaces, reducing overall anxiety in the restroom. Lastly, the device will put an end to the annoyances of uneven rips in toilet paper when manually handled by users.</p>
